# Sketchy Turtle:turtle:

A turtle that (almost) sketches any image given to it.

---

### Directions to use:

1. Change the sketch.py file and change the `INPUT_PATH` variable to your image file's path.
2. You may want/need to tune other constant values too, like the binary thresholding cutoff (`THRESHOLD_VAL`), image shape (`SHAPE`), etc.
3. Run `sketch.py`
